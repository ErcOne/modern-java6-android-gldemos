============================
Modern OpenGL/ES examples in Java are few and far between and this collection of demos showcases what is possible with OpenGL ES 3.0 / 3.1 + AEP. The purpose is to inform developers, but also provide a testbed for cross-device testing between various mobile GPUs. This repo contains only demo code and depends on [modern-java6-android-glframework](https://github.com/typhonrt/modern-java6-android-glframework)

Device requirements: Android 5.0+ / OpenGL ES 3.0+
